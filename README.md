This is work in progress. It's intended to be a comprehensive reproduction in Python of Andrew Ng's famous Coursera machine learning course. 

In addition to adhering faithfully to Andrew Ng's code-from-scratch approach, I also implemented the same tasks using Python's ML library sklearn. I show them side-by-side to demostrate that the different approaches produce the same results.

If you spot bugs/ issues, I really appreciate if you can let me know.

Cheers,

Fiona
